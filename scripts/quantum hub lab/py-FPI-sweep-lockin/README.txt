FPIvoltageSweep is a program which will synchronize
 - a voltage measurement on the Agilent voltmeter (photodiode) 
   or a counter measurement on the PicoHarp (single photon detector)
   or a counter measurement on the NI box (NOTE: has not been tested!!)
and
 - voltage steps using LockIn DAC2 on a 7265 Signal Recovery model
